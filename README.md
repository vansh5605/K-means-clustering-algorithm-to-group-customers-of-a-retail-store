The Python code implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their annual income and spending score. It begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The dataset is loaded, and the two selected features are extracted for clustering. Before applying K-means, the features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure fair distance measurements. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) for different values of k. After selecting the best k (e.g., 5), the KMeans algorithm is applied to group customers into distinct clusters. Each customer is assigned a cluster label, which is then added to the dataset. These clusters help businesses understand customer segments, enabling better-targeted marketing and service strategies.
